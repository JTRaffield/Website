		In grade school I played the Trombone for 6 years through Middle School and High School, and it was because of the band program at school that I became so interested in music.
		While volunteering at church in High School, I started to work with the praise and worship team and started to learn how to play the Bass Guitar and Drums.
		I really had fun on the drums so the leader of the team allowed me to audition for the position of drummer and I managed to impress him enough to get the position.
		Ever sense joining the Marine Corps I haven't had the time or resources to pick up any of the instruments I learned, but my enthusiasm for the art has only grown.

		My project history started while participating in the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA) and for the most part is class projects that focus on fundamental programming concepts and skills.
		That being said, on my <a href="https://github.com/JTRaffield"> Personal github page, </a> I do have extra projects that I have been creating outside of the class in an attempt to better my understanding of the programming languages.
